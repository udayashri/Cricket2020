    <h1>Indian Cricket Team</h1>
    <p><strong>The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India and Men in Blue.</strong> </p>
   <p>Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in Australia, England and South Africa.</p>
<p>Thirty-three men have captained the Indian cricket team in at least one Test match, although only six have led the team in more than 25 matches, and six have captained the team in ODIs but not Tests.</p>    
<p>In September 2007, <a href ="Mahendra Singh Dhoni.html" >Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> was named as the new captain of the ODI and T20I teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the inaugural World Twenty20 title.
    The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably with Pakistan, the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, South Africa and England have also gained prominence.</p>
